# Dust-Free Streets: Hackathon Project

## 🚀 Project Overview
**AeroClean 360** is a comprehensive, tech-driven solution designed to combat urban dust pollution. Developed for the "Dust-Free Streets" hackathon challenge, this project integrates IoT sensing, AI-driven analytics, and smart urban design to create cleaner, healthier cities.

## 📂 Repository Structure
*   **`SOLUTIONS.md`**: The master design document containing the 16-point detailed solution architecture, execution plan, and feasibility analysis.
*   *(Future)* **`src/`**: Source code for the IoT firmware and Web Dashboard.
*   *(Future)* **`simulation/`**: Python scripts for dust dispersion and route optimization modeling.

## 🏆 Core Features
1.  **Hyper-local Monitoring**: Grid of low-cost IoT dust sensors.
2.  **Smart Suppression**: Automated misting systems triggered by real-time data.
3.  **Dynamic Routing**: AI optimizes street sweeper paths based on pollution hotspots.
4.  **Citizen Action**: Gamified app for community reporting and engagement.

## ⏱️ 36-Hour Hackathon Roadmap
*   **Phase 1:** Problem Framing & Architecture (See `SOLUTIONS.md`).
*   **Phase 2:** IoT Prototyping & Backend Setup.
*   **Phase 3:** Simulation & Data Integration.
*   **Phase 4:** Frontend Dashboard & Mobile App UI.
*   **Phase 5:** Integration, Testing & Pitch Prep.

## 📖 How to Use
Read `SOLUTIONS.md` for the complete theoretical framework and implementation strategy. This document serves as the "Blue Book" for the hackathon team.
